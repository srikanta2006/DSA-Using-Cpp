💻 100 Days of DSA — Progress Tracker

Welcome to my Day-wise DSA Practice Repository!
I’m documenting my daily learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms — one concept, one day at a time 🚀

📅 Day-wise Progress
Day	Folder	Topics / Highlights
01	DAY-01
	Getting started with arrays & loops
02	DAY-02
	Solved problems on binary numbers
03	DAY-03
	more loops
04	DAY-04
	Array concepts
05	DAY-05
	Vector concepts from STL 
06	DAY-06
	Moore algo and kandane algo
07	DAY-07
	Binary exponentiation
08	DAY-08
	Two pointers
09	DAY-09
	Prefix & suffix
10	DAY-10
	Pass by reference(pointers & alias)
🧩 About Each Day

Each DAY-x folder contains all practice codes related to that day’s topic.

For every LeetCode problem I solve, I also write a short note in a file named leetcode.txt, which includes:

🧠 Intuition behind the solution

⚙️ Approach I followed

⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

This helps me revise faster and understand why a solution works — not just how.

🛠️ Tech Setup

Language: C++

Editor: VS Code

Version Control: Git & GitHub

🎯 Goal

To build strong problem-solving skills, improve logical thinking, and stay consistent with DSA before placements.
